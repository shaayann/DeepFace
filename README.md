# DeepFace

## 1. Titles and Sections:

### Face Embeddings: 
Discusses generating facial embeddings (vector representations of faces) using the DeepFace library.
### Verification: 
Explores face verification by comparing embeddings of two images to determine if they belong to the same person.
### Analysis: 
Includes functionality to analyze attributes like age, gender, race, and emotions from facial images.
### Realtime-Emotion Detection: 
Likely involves detecting emotions from a video stream or real-time inputs.

## 2. Libraries Used:

### Core AI and ML Libraries: 
numpy, deepface, matplotlib, cv2
### Auxiliary Libraries: 
PIL, base64, IPython
### Additional Tools: 
ultralytics
